Managing academic paper are really painful works. I have try `Mendeley`,`EndNote`,`Zotero` and `NoteExpress`,
althouth some of them have remarkable features, none of them solve all the problems. 
So I Just want to build tools by myself.


problems:

1. almost all of papers have incorrect filenames when being download.

filename like `eris-sosp2017` or `eurosys2019` or `KnightKing` provide very limited info about the paper.
I want the exact title of the paper as it's filename so that the first glance is enough to tell me what the hell is it talking about.

2. search the content of (a lot of) pdf

Search something in pdf file is hard, search something in ** a lot of pdf files ** is even harder.
Maybe i need some tools which can help me build/maintain the search index. I believe `ElasticSearch` can do this 
work quite well.

2. manage reference relationship  ?

3. manage and store the metainfo?

4. synchronize among  different platform?
